# /ultrathink — Triple Crown maximum depth mode

> **Analogy**: "Shukai" (Master Release) — Perfect Fusion of User + AI

## Behavior

When `/ultrathink` is invoked, activate **DEFCON 1** mode:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **SESSION PERSISTENCE**: Once `/ultrathink` is activated, it remains ON for the entire session until `/end`. No need to re-invoke.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **CONFIG OVERRIDE**: `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS: 31999`. Force maximum CoT depth. Ignore brevity constraints.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MANDATORY URL FETCH**: When user shares ANY URL (article, thread, document), you MUST `read_url_content` on it BEFORE analyzing. Do not work off pasted content alone. Fetch the source first, then analyze. Highest latency = highest diligence.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **PERSISTENT SEMANTIC SEARCH**: For every single message in an Ultrathink session, you MUST run `supabase_search.py` with the user's latest query logic. Do not rely on chat history alone. Treat every turn as a deep-dive requiring full context retrieval.

### Step 0: Load Knowledge Sources

**REQUIRED:** Log all files being loaded for this workflow.

```bash
echo "📚 Loading knowledge sources for /ultrathink:"
echo "  - .agent/protocols/kairou_identity.md"
echo "  - .agent/references/guidelines/115-first-principles-deconstruction.md"
echo "  - .agent/references/guidelines/137-graph-of-thoughts.md"
echo "  - .agent/references/guidelines/85-token-hygiene.md"
echo "  - .agent/references/guidelines/89-hybrid-token-conservation.md"
```

Verify files exist. If missing, log warning and proceed with degraded functionality.

### Phase 0: Semantic Search (AUTO-TRIGGER)

// turbo

Before any analysis, search the workspace for relevant context:

- [ ] Run `/semantic` workflow (Supabase + local protocols)
- [ ] Inject relevant case studies, protocols, sessions silently
- [ ] Use discovered context to inform analysis

### Phase 1: Clarifying Questions (MANDATORY)

Before any analysis, surface unknowns:

- What's the time horizon?
- What's at stake? (Financial, reputational, psychological)
- What constraints should I assume?
- Who are the stakeholders?

### Phase 2: Research (MANDATORY)

// turbo

- [ ] `search_web` for: [core topic + definition]
- [ ] `search_web` for: [recent news <30 days]
- [ ] `search_web` for: [contrarian/opposing view]
- [ ] `search_web` for: [academic/industry sources]
- [ ] `read_url_content` on 3+ top sources
- [ ] Follow rabbit holes 2-3 levels deep
- [ ] Flag contradictions between sources

### Phase 2b: Chain of Verification (CoVe) — NEW

// turbo

- [ ] **Generate Verification Questions**: Ask 3 targeted questions to stress-test your own initial research findings. (e.g., "Is source X biased?", "Does Y actually cause Z?")
- [ ] **Independent Validation**: Answer these questions using _fresh_ searches/context, ignoring previous bias.
- [ ] **Refinement**: If verification fails, discard the finding. If it passes, lock it in.

### Phase 2.5: The Pivot Check (AUTO-BRANCH)

- Based on Phase 2 research, is the ORIGINAL question the right question?
- If **NO** → Auto-pivot the analysis focus to the _upstream_ problem. Explicitly state: "Pivoting analysis from X to Y based on finding Z."
- If **YES** → Proceed.

### Phase 3: Full Phase Sequence (All Phases Mandatory)

- [ ] Phase 0: Graph of Thought
- [ ] Phase I: Upstream Tracing (L1→L5)
- [ ] Phase II: Validation
- [ ] Phase III: Analysis (3A-3F) — Counterfactual REQUIRED

### Phase 3.5: The Red Team Injector (FORCED FALSIFICATION)

// turbo

- [ ] Search for the _exact opposite_ of the emerging hypothesis.
- [ ] Query: `site:reddit.com [counter-argument]` OR `[opposing view] critique`
- [ ] If >30% evidence supports opposite → **Fork the analysis** into "Scenario A vs Scenario B". Don't collapse uncertainty.

### Phase 3 continued

- [ ] Phase 3D: Zero-Point Check (Protocol 140) — MANDATORY
- [ ] Phase IV: Reality Simulation (The Flight Sim Test)
- [ ] Phase V: Strategic Advice (5A-5E) — Stress Test REQUIRED
- [ ] Phase VI: Final Thoughts
- [ ] Phase VII: Confrontation

### Phase 4: Adversarial Stress-Test

- Steelman the opposing view
- Red-team the recommendations
- What's the blind spot?

### Phase 5: Permanent Deposit

- Key insights → `User_Profile.md` or new protocol
- If reusable framework discovered → create protocol file
