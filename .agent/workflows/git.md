## When to use

- You want to commit code but aren't sure how to structure the message.
- You want to check if your changes are atomic.
- You are about to push conflicting changes and need a strategy.

## Workflow

1.  **Status Check**: The agent will look at your current `git status`.
2.  **Strategy**: It will suggest `micro-commits` or `scrambled-eggs` squashing.
3.  **Execution**: It will guide you through the commands.
